# 🌍 Global Data Repository: Countries, States, and Cities

## 📄 Overview

This repository provides a comprehensive dataset for countries around the world, available in separate JSON files for each country. It includes detailed information about each country’s states and cities. The data is organized into two types for each country: a complete dataset with extensive details, and an abbreviated version that contains key attributes for quick reference.

## ✨ Features

- **📚 Complete Country Details:** Each JSON file includes full details of the country such as its name, ISO codes, phone code, currency information, geographic coordinates, timezones, translations, and more.
- **🔍 Abbreviated Country Details:** Each file also contains a condensed version with essential information like country name, short name (ISO code), phone code, currency, and major administrative divisions.
- **🏛 Structured Data for States and Cities:** Information about states and their respective cities is included, detailing the hierarchical administrative divisions within each country.
- **📁 Separate Files for Each Country:** Data for each country is isolated into individual files named uniquely based on the country's ID and name, making it easy to manage and access specific country data.
